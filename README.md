## Machine Learning Projects
These projects cover a variety of topics in data science.
The categorisation is a rough outline.


### Machine Learning | Supervised Learning

<b>Laptop Price Prediction in Python</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Laptop-Price-Prediction<br>
Supervised learning to predict laptop price from a dataset of laptop features and prices.
Exploring what features contribute to laptop pricing.
Laptop price can be generalised, but more data on how old each laptop model is would yield better signal.
<br><br>

<b>Laptop Price Prediction in R</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Laptop-Price-Prediction-in-R<br>
To predict laptop prices and determine what features impact this.
Translating my laptop price prediction in python into R. 
Data exploration demonstration is shown on the dataset, data is then processed as per the findings from the previous experiment in python, and then modelling is performed.
<br><br>

<b>Airline Customer Satisfaction</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Airline-Customer-Satisfaction<br>
Predict airline customer satisfaction with classification modeling.
Performing data preparation and binary classification modeling on Airline Customer Satisfaction in Python. Related report is included in the report section below.
Support Vector Machine model best fit on data with 94% accuracy.
<br><br>

<b>Car Emissions Prediction in Scala</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Regression-in-Scala<br>
Model car emissions with Regression in Scala.
Data exploration, cleaning, and modeling using Scala in Jupyter Notebook with machine learning and Spark libraries.
<br><br>

<b>Steam platform recommendation system</b><br>
Link coming soon<br>
Recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering, including a Streamlit dashboard.
This project is completed and will be uploaded soon.
<br><br>

<b>Apache Spark ML</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/apache-spark-ml<br>
Perform Machine Learning in Spark.
Machine Learning with Spark. Notebooks are completed as part of IBM's Data Engineering Professional Certificate.
Basic ML implementation in Spark.
<br><br>

<b>Data Analysis in R; Statistics, Probability, Regression</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/data-analysis-with-r<br>
Perform data analysis in R.
RMarkdown files are completed as part of the Data Analysis with R Specialization with Duke University.
Questions and exercises completed in R.
<br><br>

### Machine Learning | Unsupervised Learning

<b>Dimensionality Reduction on Unknown Data</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Dimensionality-Reduction-on-Unknown-Data<br>
Perform dimensionality reduction on data without context while keeping 99.5% of the variance.
Project from completing the HDip with CCT. Dataset is Air Pressure System failures in Scania Trucks, it features a target feature of failure types. It has anonymized features, lacks context, and has missing data. These discrepancies are investigated with data exploration and the nature of the missing data is understood in relation to failures. Imputation methods are trialed and the data is modeled.
Relationships in the missing data are highlighted. Imputation methods and principal component analysis are performed. Some classifications are then performed on the data.
<br><br>

<b>Market Basket Analysis on Grocery Purchases</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Affinity-Analysis-on-Grocery-Purchases<br>
Performs MBA on groceries data, and then performs a classification to determine based on customer recency.<br><br>

<b>Sentiment Analysis on News Headlines</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Sentiment-Analysis-on-News-Headlines<br>
Text processing and sentiment analysis of news headlines.
Naive Baise model with 0.88% accuracy.<br><br>

## Deep Learning

These are a collection of projects in Deep Learning using TensorFlow, which feature RNN time series and a fully connected neural network in TensorFlow.js.

### Deep Learning | Time-Series Analysis

<b>Time-Series Analysis on Stock Data</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Time-Series-Analysis-on-Stock-Data<br>
Time-Series analysis on Disney closing stock. Uses sequential LSTM and optimises with GridSearchCV.
0.86 r2 on unseen data.
<br><br>


### Deep Learning | Computer Vision

<b>Handwritten Digit Recognition in JavaScript</b><br>
https://github.com/Lughaidh-w/Digit-Recognition-in-JavaScript<br>
Perform Machine Learning in JavaScript.
Using the MNIST dataset, create a Neural network for image recognition. MNIST dataset is a solved problem but implementing this in JS expands the uses of the project into app development. Interesting apps exist that use something similar to create Sudoku solvers that leverage a mobile phone's camera.
TensorFlow.js creates an accurate Neural Network for digit classification.
<br><br>


## Other Projects
